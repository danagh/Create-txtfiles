This repository has two small scripts:
1. A script that takes an original .txt-file as input together with the values you want to change. A new .txt-file names output_wihout_excel will then be created. Run the script in the terminal with node without_excel.js input.txt value1 new_value value2 new_value.
2. A script that takes an original .txt-file as input together with a .xlsx-file. For each row the script will create a .txt-file in the folder output_with_excel with the corresponding changes. Run the script in the terminal with node with_excel.js input.txt input.xlsx.
